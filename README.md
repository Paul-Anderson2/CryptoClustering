# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

There is a known memory leak issue that affects this code. Slack Overflow helped me write code that address it. There is attribution in the code as well.
